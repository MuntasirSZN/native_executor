//! Mailbox-based message passing for safe cross-thread communication.
//!
//! This module provides a [`Mailbox`] type that enables asynchronous message passing
//! to a value owned by a background task. The mailbox ensures thread-safe access
//! to the contained value by serializing all operations through a message queue.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The mailbox pattern is useful when you need to:
//! - Share mutable state across threads safely
//! - Process operations on a value sequentially
//! - Avoid blocking when sending updates
//! - Make async calls that return values
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use native_executor::Mailbox;
//! use std::collections::HashMap;
//!
//! // Create a mailbox containing a HashMap on the main executor
//! let mailbox = Mailbox::main(HashMap::<String, i32>::new());
//!
//! // Send updates to the value (non-blocking)
//! mailbox.handle(|map| {
//!     map.insert("key".to_string(), 42);
//! });
//!
//! // Make async calls that return values
//! let value = mailbox.call(|map| {
//!     map.get("key").copied().unwrap_or(0)
//! }).await;
//! ```

/// A mailbox for sending messages to a value owned by a background task.
///
/// `Mailbox<T>` provides thread-safe access to a value of type `T` by serializing
/// all operations through an async message queue. The value is owned by a background
/// task that processes incoming messages sequentially.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// * `T` - The type of value contained in the mailbox. Must be `'static` to ensure
///   the background task can own it safely.
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// The mailbox enables other threads to safely access a value living on another thread
/// without explicit locks. The mailbox handle itself is always `Send` and `Sync`,
/// allowing it to be shared across threads. All operations on the value are serialized
/// through an async message queue, providing lock-free concurrent access. When `T` is
/// not `Send`, the value remains pinned to its original thread but can still be safely
/// accessed from other threads through the mailbox.
